# spatialphy

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`spatialphy` is an R package for spatial phylogentic analysis. The field
of spatial phylogenetics focuses on accounting for evolutionary
relationships among taxa when describing biodiversity patterns, an
approach that has a number of advantages over species-based accounting.
This library currently includes functions for computing:

- diversity measures like phylogenetic diversity
- turnover measures like phylogenetic betaendemism
- phylogenetic regionalization
- phylogenetic conservation prioritization

One feature that differentiates `spatialphy` from some similar packages
is that in addition to working with binary presence/absence data, it’s
also designed to work with continuous quantities such as occurrence
probabilities or abunances. These quantities are treated as weights
throughout all the analyses in the package, avoiding the need to discard
information by thresholding the data.

## Installation

This package is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version
of spatialphy like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matthewkling/spatialphy")
```

## Examples

Spatial phylogenetic analyses require two essential ingredients: data on
the geographic distributions of a set of organisms, and a phylogeny
representing their evolutionary relationships. All workflows in the
spatialphy package involve creating a data set of class `'spatialphy'`
containing these necessary components. A user would normally define this
object with their own data using the `sphy()` function, but we can also
simulate a demonstration dataset using `sphy_simulate()`.

To get started, let’s load the `spatialphy` library and simulate a demo
data set. To get a peek at the underlying data, let’s plot the
geographic ranges of the terminal species:

``` r
library(spatialphy)
library(tmap); library(magrittr)
set.seed(123)
sp <- sphy_simulate(n_tips = 20, n_x = 50, n_y = 50)
tm_shape(get_tip_occs(sp, spatial = TRUE)) + 
      tm_raster(palette = "inferno", style = "cont", title = "occurrence\nprobability")
```

#### Alpha diversity

We can pass this our `spatialphy` object to various other functions in
the library. The `sphy_diversity()` function calculates a number of
alpha diversity measures, including phylogenetic diversity (PD) and
phylogenetic endemism (PE), among others. Let’s calculate the diversity
metrics and make a plot of PD:

``` r
div <- sphy_diversity(sp)
names(div)
#>  [1] "TR"  "CR"  "PD"  "TE"  "CE"  "PE"  "Em"  "RPD" "PEm" "RPE"
tm_shape(div$PD) + tm_raster(palette = "inferno", style = "cont")
```

We can also use randomization to calculate the significance of these
diversity metrics under a null model, using the `sphy_rand()` function.
The default null model uses a stratified randomization designed for use
with continuous occurrence data. Let’s run 100 randomizations and plot
the results for PE. This is a quantile value that gives the proportion
of randomizations in which observed PE was greater than randomized PE in
a given grid cell (if you wanted to identify “statistically significant”
grid cells in a one-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, these would be cells
with values greater than 0.95).

``` r
rand <- sphy_rand(sp, n_rand = 100)

#### Beta diversity (turnover)

We can also look at patterns in the phylogenetic similarity among
locations. The first step here is to compute the community phylogenetic
distance between every pair of sites, using the `sphy_dist()` function
to add a pairwise distance matrix as an additional component in our
spatialphy dataset.

``` r
sp <- sphy_dist(sp, add = TRUE)
```

Having done this, we can then assess spatial turnover patterns in a
couple ways. We can qualitatively visualize compositional differences by
converting the distance matrix to a set of colors representing how
similar two sites are to each other, using the `sphy_rgb()` function:

``` r
sp %>%
      sphy_rgb(method = "cmds") %>%
      tm_shape() +
      tm_rgb(max.value = 1) +
      tm_layout(title = "Phylogenetic ordination")
```

<img src="man/figures/README-rgb-1.png" width="50%" />

We can also perform a more formal cluster analysis that splits the
landscape into a set of evolutionary bioregions, using the
`sphy_regions()` function. Let’s ask for eight regions using the
“kmeans” clustering method:

``` r
sp %>%
      sphy_regions(k = 8, method = "kmeans") %>%
      tm_shape() +
      tm_raster(style = "cat", palette = "Dark2",
                title = "phylogenetic region") +
      tm_layout(legend.outside = T)
```

#### Conservation prioritization

Finally, this package can perform a basic spatial conservation
prioritization, identifying priority locations for the creation of new
protected areas in order to maximize biodiversity protection. This is
done using the `sphy_prioritize()` function, which uses a greedy forward
stepwise algorithm to produce a nested ranking of conservation
priorities.

In addition to the required spatial phylogenetic dataset, there is the
option to supply a raster layer indicating the locations and
effectiveness of existing protected areas. We could also modify
parameters that specify the effective level of protection provided by
new reserves, as well as the shape of the “benefit” function that
determines the relative importance of protecting the initial populations
of every taxon versus more populations of more phylogenetically distinct
taxa. But for this example let’s stick with the defaults. In the map
below, the highest-priority sites are shown in yellow.

``` r
sp %>%
      sphy_prioritize() %>%
      tm_shape() + 
      tm_raster(palette = "-inferno", style = "log10",
                title = "conservation\npriorities") + 
      tm_layout(legend.outside = T)
